# Predictive-Maintenance-Project 

Machine Failure Prediction Using Machine Learning for Predictive Maintenance



# Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting machine failures using machine learning techniques. By analyzing operational data, the model identifies patterns that indicate potential failures, helping organizations take preventive actions and reduce downtime

# Technologies Used

1 Python

2 Pandas & NumPy – Data manipulation

3 Matplotlib 

4 Standardscaler

5 Random Forest classifier

6 SVC & DBSCAN

7 KNN & K-means


# Project Workflow


Import required libraries
Load and explore the dataset
Clean and preprocess the data
Split data into training and testing sets
Train a Random Forest classifier
Evaluate model performance (confusion matrix, ROC curve, cross-validation)
Save and reload the trained model

# Model Performance


The Random Forest model was used for classification and evaluated using:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-score

ROC Curve

Cross-validation

These metrics ensure the model is reliable and generalizes well to unseen data.
